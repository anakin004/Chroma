Math Library in C++ 

- This library is currently meant to be used in my game engine, but it can be exapanded on and used in other projects, so I decided to make it a seperate repo, and updating is alongside my game engine development branch

- working on making examples in opengl

- regarding premake - it is used in my engine, not needed to simply use the library
